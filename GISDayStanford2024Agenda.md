In the last two years, AI machine learning has exploded in prominence. One of the key concepts used in the modeling and storage of AI is vectors. We’ll discuss the use of vectors in the AI lifecycle, the basics of vector databases, and dive into real-world demos. By the end, you’ll be equipped to explore vector data management further in your own work.
