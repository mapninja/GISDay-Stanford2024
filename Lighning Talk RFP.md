## What’s so spatial about your project?

Are you leveraging **points, lines, polygons, pixels and properties with AI/ML methods**, at Stanford?

The Stanford Geospatial Center will be hosting GISDay@Stanford, Wednesday, November 20th at The David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford's Green Library. This year, we're planning a half day of Lighting Talks, Deep Dives and Guest Speakers and we want you to hear from you! 

[Our agenda this year](https://github.com/mapninja/GISDay-Stanford2024/blob/main/GISDay%40Stanford%202024%20Agenda.md) is shaping up to revolve around the intersection of geospatial data sources, AI and particularly the use of foundational models.   

We invite you to submit your ideas, for GISDay@Stanford. We want to hear how you are using AI/ML methods in leveraging the WHERE in your research.

If you’ve got something to say about how ***spatial*** your research is, let us know, by filling out this form, and we’ll get back to you soon!
