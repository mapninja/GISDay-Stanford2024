## What’s so spatial about your project?



Are you leveraging points, lines, polygons, pixels and properties with AI/ML methods, at Stanford?

Our agenda this year is shaping up to revolve around the intersection of geospatial data streams, AI and particularly the use of foundational models. 

Whether you are student, faculty or staff,... whether it’s your Capstone Project, Dissertation Research, a recent conference talk, or just about anything with a spatial data component, we invite you to submit your ideas, for GISDay@Stanford. We want to hear how you are leveraging the WHERE in your research.
If you’ve got something to say about how spatial your research is, let us know, by filling out this form, and we’ll be getting back to you within the next week!
